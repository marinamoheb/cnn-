Avoid using built in functions in doing step 3 and step 4.
Use any CNN trained for MNIST handwritten digit classification (that classify between the digits from 0 to 9).
After training the model, evaluate it using the testing data and get the predicted class of the testing image samples.
By comparing the predicted class labels with the actual class labels (Ground Truth), build the Confusion Matrix of the ten classes (digits from 0 to 9).
For each class (digit):
Calculate the precision, recall, F1 score.
